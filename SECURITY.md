# Security Policy

Security is the primary design constraint for this crate.

## Supported Versions

Until `1.0.0`, only the latest published pre-`1.0` version receives security
fixes. After `1.0.0`, the project will document a stable support window in this
file.

## Reporting A Vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for suspected vulnerabilities.

Report privately through GitHub Security Advisories for
`valkyoth/openbao-rust-crate`, or contact the maintainers through the private
channel listed in the repository profile.

Please include:

- affected version or commit;
- exact feature flags used;
- operating system and Rust version;
- whether OpenBao was sealed, standby, or active;
- proof of impact;
- reproduction steps that avoid exposing real tokens or secrets.

## Security Baseline

- `unsafe_code = "forbid"`.
- All token-bearing APIs accept `secrecy::SecretString`.
- Secret values must never be logged by this crate.
- Any new auth method must include tests proving token redaction.
- Any endpoint accepting user paths must use the shared path validator.
- Any API that can expose secret material must return caller-selected typed
  payloads, allowing users to wrap sensitive fields in secret types.
- TLS verification must remain enabled by default.
- Redirects must remain disabled by default.
- TLS 1.2 or newer must remain enforced by default.
- Token accessors are treated as secret material.
- Plain HTTP is allowed only by explicit localhost opt-in.
- New dependencies require a release-plan justification and `cargo deny` review.

## Pentest Gate

Every release tag requires a pentest report from the project owner before tag
creation. The release notes must record:

- report identifier or local evidence path;
- tested commit;
- scope;
- unresolved findings;
- accepted risks, if any.

## OpenBao Compatibility

This crate tracks the official OpenBao API documentation. The API is currently
documented as `/v1`, and OpenBao warns that compatibility is not yet guaranteed
for every auth method and secrets engine. Any behavior derived from live testing
rather than documentation must be marked as such in docs and tests.
